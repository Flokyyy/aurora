## üíé Aurora

- Aurora is a fully automated royalty enforcement tool with On-Chain NFT-Freezing and Discord integration for users to pay the projects creator royalty thereby unlocking their NFT.
- Due to the current situation, we are trying to restore the royalty inflow for projects. To solve this problem, we would like to offer a solution that allows projects to request the desired royalty from users who are not paying the royalty by freezing their NFTs until the Creator Royalty was paid. 
=> As a result, a royalty is required from the user which they can pay using the simple discord integration. 

- With the help of our tool, projects can again demand flexible royalties from their users in the long term without giving anyone access to the update-authority, as Aurora is self-hosted and update-authorities therefore stay in the hands of each project.

# üí° Demo
- Aurora can be tested inside our discord: https://discord.gg/q7pJcPgvKz (Royalties are paid for: NexiLabs) https://magiceden.io/marketplace/nexilabs
- If you want to live test the tool head over to MagicEden and buy a Nexi Orb without any royalties. The Orb will be locked afterwards. Join our discord:  
https://discord.gg/UeHDvRkv. Click on the "Pay-Royalty" channel. And then just follow the process described in [Royalty Payment Process](#üí∏ Royalty Payment Process)

# Default URI Template
- This is the default URI template which is used for the metadata change. 
- This json file must be uploaded and needs to be accessable all time. We therefore suggest uploading this to Arweave etc.)
- Make sure to change all required fields before using this, otherwise your metadata can get screwed up.

# FAQ
- Is this kind of payment secure? Yes, this method is even much more secure than current models, since the user's wallet does not come into direct contact with any of our smart contracts, since no login or signing is required. Users only need to send a transaction to a given address.

# Solana transactions for Java
- Because there is no direct API for Java we used the Solana Cli (https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) in order to perform transactions on the Solana Blockchain. So make sure to have the Solana Cli installed if you use ever use Aurora's code outside the general installation.
