## üíé Aurora Royalt Enforcement
- Aurora is a fully automated royalty enforcement tool with On-Chain NFT-Locking and Discord integration for users to pay the projects creator royalty thereby unlocking their NFT.

# üìñ Description 
- Aurora automatically deactivates any NFT in your collection that interacts with an optional royalty marketplace by swapping the image with a warning and replacing the NFT name. Also users are onced their NFT is locked not able to verify for a Holder role of a project. 
- With the help of our tool, projects can again demand flexible royalties from their users in the long term without giving anyone access to the update-authority, as Aurora is self-hosted and update-authorities therefore stay in the hands of each project.

# üí° Demo
- Aurora can be tested inside our developer discord: https://discord.gg/q7pJcPgvKz or the NexiLabs [Discord](https://discord.gg/UeHDvRkv).
- For the Demo Royalties are paid for: [NexiLabs](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/nexilabs)
- If you want to live test the tool head over to MagicEden and buy a Nexi Orb without any royalties. The Orb will be locked afterwards. 
- Join the NexiLabs Discord and click on the "Pay-Royalty" channel. 
- Follow the process described in [Royalty Payment Process](https://github.com/Flokyyy/aurora#-royalty-payment-process).
- Once the Royalty is paid the Orb will be unlocked.

# Default URI Template
- This is the default URI template which is used for the metadata change. 
- This json file must be uploaded and needs to be accessable all time. We therefore suggest uploading this to Arweave etc.
- Make sure to change all required fields before using this, otherwise your metadata can get screwed up.

# FAQ
- Is this kind of payment secure? Yes, this method is even much more secure than current models, since the user's wallet does not come into direct contact with any of our smart contracts, since no login or signing is required. Users only need to send a transaction to a given address.

# Solana transactions for Java
- Because there is no direct API for Java we used the Solana Cli or Metaboss in order to perform transactions on the Solana Blockchain. So make sure to have those tools installed if you selfhost Aurora.
