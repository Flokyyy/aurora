# Aurora
- Aurora is a fully automated royalty collection and distribution bot tool for projects which can be installed with 1-click directly into any discord server.
- Due to the current situation, we are trying to restore the royalty inflow for projects. We believe that no royalties should be charged on transactions. It is possible to circumvent them anyway, since there is no consistent royalty protocol for general (SPL) token transfers. 
- To solve this problem, we would like to offer a solution that allows projects to request the desired royalty from users who are entering the community and are applying for their "Holder" role, or are requesting special channel access. 

-> As a result, a one-time royalty is required from the user, which is then automatically sent to the respective stored treasury wallet of the project. 
- With the help of our tool, projects can again demand flexible royalties from their users in the long term without incurring any fees when trading.

# FAQ 

Is this kind of payment secure? 
Yes, this method is even much more secure than current models, since the user's wallet does not come into direct contact with any of our smart contracts, since no login or signing is required. Users only need to send a transaction to a given address.
